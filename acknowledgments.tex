Writing this dissertation would not have been possible without the advice, encouragement, and kindness of my advisors, colleagues, family, and friends.

I first want to thank my advisor, Saul Perlmutter, for being such an enthusiastic and supportive mentor. 

My qualification exam and dissertation committee members were also instrumental in shaping 

Jeffrey Epstein

Finally, I could not have finished writing all this up without the tireless support (and homecooked meals) of Michael Mangus; thank you for always reminding me what I am capable of.
