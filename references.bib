	abstract     = {We present the first public version (v0.2) of the open-source and community-developed Python package, Astropy. This package provides core astronomy-related functionality to the community, including support for domain-specific file formats such as flexible image transport system (FITS) files, Virtual Observatory (VO) tables, and common ASCII table formats, unit and physical quantity conversions, physical constants specific to astronomy, celestial coordinate and time transformations, world coordinate system (WCS) support, generalized containers for representing gridded as well as tabular data, and a framework for cosmological transformations and conversions. Significant functionality is under active development, such as a model fitting framework, VO client and server tools, and aperture and point spread function (PSF) photometry tools. The core development team is actively making additions and enhancements to the current code base, and we encourage anyone interested to participate in the development of future Astropy versions.},

	abstract     = {We employ 76 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with optical spectrophotometry within 2.5 days of B-band maximum light obtained by the Nearby Supernova Factory to derive the impact of Si and Ca features on the supernovae intrinsic luminosity and determine a dust reddening law. We use the equivalent width of Si ii λ4131 in place of the light curve stretch to account for ﬁrst-order intrinsic luminosity variability. The resulting empirical spectral reddening law exhibits strong features that are associated with Ca ii and Si ii λ6355. After applying a correction based on the Ca ii H\&K equivalent width we ﬁnd a reddening law consistent with a Cardelli extinction law. Using the same input data, we compare this result to synthetic rest-frame UBVRI-like photometry to mimic literature observations. After corrections for signatures correlated with Si ii λ4131 and Ca ii H\&K equivalent widths and introducing an empirical correlation between colors, we determine the dust component in each band. We ﬁnd a value of the total-to-selective extinction ratio, RV = 2.8 ± 0.3. This agrees with the Milky Way value, in contrast to the low RV values found in most previous analyses. This result suggests that the long-standing controversy in interpreting SN Ia colors and their compatibility with a classical extinction law, which is critical to their use as cosmological probes, can be explained by the treatment of the dispersion in colors, and by the variability of features apparent in SN Ia spectra.},

	abstract     = {We investigate the use of a wide variety of spectroscopic measurements to determine distances to low-redshift Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) in the Hubble ﬂow observed through the CfA Supernova Program. We consider linear models for predicting distances to SN Ia using light-curve width and color parameters (determined using the SALT2 light-curve ﬁtter) and a spectroscopic indicator, and evaluate the resulting Hubble diagram scatter using a cross-validation procedure. We conﬁrm the ability of spectral ﬂux ratios alone at maximum light to reduce the scatter of Hubble residuals by ∼10\% [weighted rms, or WRMS = 0.189 ± 0.026 mag for the ﬂux ratio R(6630/4400)] with respect to the standard combination of light-curve width and color, for which WRMS = 0.204 ± 0.029 mag. When used in combination with the SALT2 color parameter, the color-corrected ﬂux ratio Rc(6420/5290) at maximum light leads to an even lower scatter (WRMS = 0.175 ± 0.025 mag), although the improvement has low statistical signiﬁcance ({\textless}2σ) given the size of our sample (26 SN Ia). We highlight the importance of an accurate relative ﬂux calibration and the failure of this method for highly-reddened objects. Comparison with synthetic spectra from 2D delayed-detonation explosion models shows that the correlation of R(6630/4400) with SN Ia absolute magnitudes can be largely attributed to intrinsic color variations and not to reddening by dust in the host galaxy. We consider ﬂux ratios at other ages, as well as the use of pairs of ﬂux ratios, revealing the presence of small-scale intrinsic spectroscopic variations in the iron-group-dominated absorption features around ∼4300 Å and ∼4800 Å. The best ﬂux ratio overall is the color-corrected Rc(4610/4260) at t = −2.5 d from maximum light, which leads to ∼30\% lower scatter (WRMS = 0.143 ± 0.020 mag) with respect to the standard combination of light-curve width and color, at ∼2σ signiﬁcance. We examine other spectroscopic indicators related to line-proﬁle morphology (absorption velocity, pseudo-equivalent width etc.), but none appear to lead to a signiﬁcant improvement over the standard light-curve width and color parameters. We discuss the use of spectra in measuring more precise distances to SN Ia and the implications for future surveys which seek to determine the properties of dark energy.},

	abstract     = {Using archival data of low-redshift (z {\textless} 0:01; Center for Astrophysics and SUSPECT databases) Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and recent observations of high-redshift (0:16 {\textless} z {\textless} 0:64) SNe Ia, we study the ‘‘uniformity’’ of the spectroscopic properties of nearby and distant SNe Ia. We ﬁnd no difference in the measurements we describe here. In this paper we base our analysis solely on line-proﬁle morphology, focusing on measurements of the velocity location of maximum absorption (vabs) and peak emission (vpeak). Our measurement technique makes it easier to compare low and high signal-to-noise ratio observations. We also quantify the associated sources of error, assessing the effect of line blending with assistance from the parameterized code SYNOW. We ﬁnd that the evolution of vabs and vpeak for our sample lines (Ca ii k3945, Si ii k6355, and S ii kk5454, 5640) is similar for both the low- and high-redshift samples. We ﬁnd that vabs for the weak S ii kk5454, 5640 lines and vpeak for S ii k5454 can be used to identify fast-declining [Ám15(B) {\textgreater} 1:7] SNe Ia, which are also subluminous. In addition, we give the ﬁrst direct evidence in two high-z SN Ia spectra of a double-absorption feature in Ca ii k3945, an event also observed, although infrequently, in lowredshift SN Ia spectra (6 out of 22 SNe Ia in our local sample). Moreover, echoing the recent studies of Dessart \& Hillier in the context of Type II supernovae (SNe II), we see similar P Cygni line proﬁles in our large sample of SN Ia spectra. First, the magnitude of the velocity location at maximum proﬁle absorption may underestimate that at the continuum photosphere, as observed, for example, in the optically thinner line S ii k5640. Second, we report for the ﬁrst time the unambiguous and systematic intrinsic blueshift of peak emission of optical P Cygni line proﬁles in SN Ia spectra, by as much as 8000 km sÀ1. All the high-z SNe Ia analyzed in this paper were discovered and followed up by the ESSENCE collaboration and are now publicly available.},

	abstract     = {We introduce a method for identifying “twin” Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia)and using them to improve distance measurements. This novel approach to SN Ia standardization is made possible by spectrophotometric time series observations from the Nearby Supernova Factory (SNfactory). We begin with a well-measured set of SNe, ﬁnd pairs whose spectra match well across the entire optical window, and then test whether this leads to a smaller dispersion in their absolute brightnesses. This analysis is completed in a blinded fashion, ensuring that decisions made in implementing the method do not inadvertently bias the result. We ﬁnd that pairs of SNe with more closely matched spectra indeed have reduced brightness dispersion. We are able to standardize this initial set of SNfactory SNe to 0.083±0.012 mag, implying a dispersion of 0.072±0.010 mag in the absence of peculiar velocities. We estimate that with larger numbers of comparison SNe, e.g., using the ﬁnal SNfactory spectrophotometric data set as a reference, this method will be capable of standardizing high-redshift SNe to within 0.06–0.07 mag. These results imply that at least 3/4 of the variance in Hubble residuals in current SN cosmology analyses is due to previously unaccounted-for astrophysical differences among the SNe.},

	abstract     = {Recently, using a large low-redshift sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), we discovered a relation between SN Ia ejecta velocity and intrinsic color that improves the distance precision of SNe Ia and reduces potential systematic biases related to dust reddening. No SN Ia cosmological results have yet made a correction for the “velocity–color” relation. To test the existence of such a relation and constrain its properties at high redshift, we examine a sample of 75 SNe Ia discovered and observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II Supernova Survey and Supernova Legacy Survey. From each spectrum, we measure ejecta velocities at maximum brightness for the Ca H\&K and Si ii λ6355 features, vC0a H\&K and vS0i ii, respectively. Using SN light curve parameters, we determine the intrinsic Bmax − Vmax for each SN. Similar to what was found at low redshift, we ﬁnd that SNe Ia with higher ejecta velocity tend to be intrinsically redder than SNe Ia with lower ejecta velocity. The distributions of ejecta velocities for SNe Ia at low and high redshift are similar, indicating that current cosmological results should have little bias related to the velocity–color relation. Additionally, we ﬁnd a slight (2.4σ signiﬁcant) trend between SN Ia ejecta velocity and host-galaxy mass such that SNe Ia in high-mass host galaxies tend to have lower ejecta velocities as probed by vC0a H\&K. These results emphasize the importance of spectroscopy for SN Ia cosmology.},

	abstract     = {We use a sample of 121 spectroscopically normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to show that their intrinsic color is correlated with their ejecta velocity, as measured from the blueshift of the Si ii λ6355 feature near maximum brightness, vSi ii. The SN Ia sample was originally used by Wang et al. to show that the relationship between color excess and peak magnitude, which in the absence of intrinsic color differences describes a reddening law, was different for two subsamples split by vSi ii (deﬁned as “Normal” and “High Velocity”). We verify this result, but ﬁnd that the two subsamples have the same reddening law when extremely reddened events (E(B − V ) {\textgreater} 0.35 mag) are excluded. We also show that (1) the High-Velocity subsample is offset by ∼0.06 mag to the red from the Normal subsample in the (Bmax − Vmax)–MV plane, (2) the Bmax − Vmax cumulative distribution functions of the two subsamples have nearly identical shapes, but the High-Velocity subsample is offset by ∼0.07 mag to the red in Bmax − Vmax, and (3) the bluest High-Velocity SNe Ia are ∼0.10 mag redder than the bluest Normal SNe Ia. Together, this evidence indicates a difference in intrinsic color for the subsamples. Accounting for this intrinsic color difference reduces the scatter in Hubble residuals from 0.190 mag to 0.130 mag for SNe Ia with AV 0.7 mag. The scatter can be further reduced to 0.109 mag by exclusively using SNe Ia from the Normal subsample. Additionally, this result can at least partially explain the anomalously low values of RV found in large SN Ia samples. We explain the correlation between ejecta velocity and color as increased line blanketing in the High-Velocity SNe Ia, causing them to become redder. We discuss some implications of this result, and stress the importance of spectroscopy for future SN Ia cosmology surveys, with particular focus on the design of WFIRST.},

Using a sample of 1630 optical spectra of 255 SNe, based primarily on data from the CfA Supernova Program, we examine how the velocity evolution and line strengths of Si II λ6355 and Ca II H\&K are related to the B − V color at peak brightness. We ﬁnd that the maximum-light velocity of Si II λ6355 and Ca II H\&K and the maximum-light pseudo-equivalent width of Si II λ6355 are correlated with intrinsic color, with intrinsic color having a linear relation with the Si II λ6355 measurements. Ca II H\&K does not have a linear relation with intrinsic color, but lower-velocity SNe tend to be intrinsically bluer. Combining the spectroscopic measurements does not improve intrinsic color inference. The intrinsic color scatter is larger for higher-velocity SNe Ia — even after removing a linear trend with velocity — indicating that lower-velocity SNe Ia are more “standard crayons.” Employing information derived from SN Ia spectra has the potential to improve the measurements of extragalactic distances and the cosmological properties inferred from them.},

In emphasizing the general picture of the life cycles of stars and the physics responsible, it also allows prospective specialists a taste of many of the detailed aspects of this mature discipline. The authors develop a solid foundation in important theory that is often overlooked in typical courses yet steer clear of extraneous intensive mathematics and physics. Topics include: *The life stories of stars explained by observation and theory *Equations of state of stellar material *Basic radiative transfer and stellar spectra *Stellar energy sources and nucleosynthesis *Phenomenological approaches to convection *Numerical techniques for computation of stellar evolution Keeping pace with recent developments, the authors incorporate important elements such as asteroseismology, and the effects of rotation and magnetic fields. This edition contains an extensive set of exercises that supplement and expand on the text.

	abstract     = {Brighter Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have broader, more slowly declining B-band light curves than dimmer SNe Ia. We study the physical origin of this width-luminosity relation (WLR) using detailed radiative transfer calculations of Chandrasekhar mass SN Ia models. We find that the luminosity dependence of the diffusion time (emphasized in previous studies) is in fact of secondary relevance in understanding the model WLR. Instead, the essential physics involves the luminosity dependence of the spectroscopic/color evolution of SNe Ia. Following maximum-light, the SN colors are increasingly affected by the development of numerous Fe II/Co II lines which blanket the B-band and, at the same time, increase the emissivity at longer wavelengths. Because dimmer SNe Ia are generally cooler, they experience an earlier onset of Fe III to Fe II recombination in the iron-group rich layers of ejecta, resulting in a more rapid evolution of the SN colors to the red. The faster B-band decline rate of dimmer SNe Ia thus reflects their faster ionization evolution.},

	abstract     = {We investigate the statistical dependence of the peak intrinsic colors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) on their expansion velocities at maximum light, measured from the Si ii λ6355 spectral feature. We construct a new hierarchical Bayesian regression model, accounting for the random effects of intrinsic scatter, measurement error, and reddening by host galaxy dust, and implement a Gibbs sampler and deviance information criteria to estimate the correlation. The method is applied to the apparent colors from BVRI light curves and Si ii velocity data for 79 nearby SNe Ia. The apparent color distributions of high-velocity (HV) and normal velocity (NV) supernovae exhibit signiﬁcant discrepancies for B − V and B − R, but not other colors. Hence, they are likely due to intrinsic color differences originating in the B band, rather than dust reddening. The mean intrinsic B − V and B − R color differences between HV and NV groups are 0.06 ± 0.02 and 0.09 ± 0.02 mag, respectively. A linear model ﬁnds signiﬁcant slopes of −0.021 ± 0.006 and −0.030 ± 0.009 mag (103 km s−1)−1 for intrinsic B − V and B − R colors versus velocity, respectively. Because the ejecta velocity distribution is skewed toward high velocities, these effects imply non-Gaussian intrinsic color distributions with skewness up to +0.3. Accounting for the intrinsiccolor–velocity correlation results in corrections to AV extinction estimates as large as −0.12 mag for HV SNe Ia and +0.06 mag for NV events. Velocity measurements from SN Ia spectra have the potential to diminish systematic errors from the confounding of intrinsic colors and dust reddening affecting supernova distances.},

	abstract     = {We present 2603 spectra of 462 nearby Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), including 2065 previously unpublished spectra, obtained during 1993–2008 through the Center for Astrophysics Supernova Program. There are on average eight spectra for each of the 313 SNe Ia with at least two spectra. Most of the spectra were obtained with the FAST spectrograph at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory 1.5 m telescope and reduced in a consistent manner, making this data set well suited for studies of SN Ia spectroscopic diversity. Using additional data from the literature, we study the spectroscopic and photometric properties of SNe Ia as a function of spectroscopic class using the classiﬁcation schemes of Branch et al. and Wang et al. The width–luminosity relation appears to be steeper for SNe Ia with broader lines, although the result is not statistically signiﬁcant with the present sample. Based on the evolution of the characteristic Si ii λ6355 line, we propose improved methods for measuring velocity gradients, revealing a larger range than previously suspected, from ∼0 to ∼400 km s−1 day−1 considering the instantaneous velocity decline rate at maximum light. We ﬁnd a weaker and less signiﬁcant correlation between Si ii velocity and intrinsic B − V color at maximum light than reported by Foley et al., owing to a more comprehensive treatment of uncertainties and host galaxy dust. We study the extent of nuclear burning and the presence of unburnt carbon in the outermost layers of the ejecta and report new detections of C ii λ6580 in 23 early-time SN Ia spectra. The frequency of C ii detections is not higher in SNe Ia with bluer colors or narrower light curves, in conﬂict with the recent results of Thomas et al. Based on nebular spectra of 27 SNe Ia, we ﬁnd no relation between the FWHM of the iron emission feature at ∼4700 Å and Δm15(B) after removing the two low-luminosity SN 1986G and SN 1991bg, suggesting that the peak luminosity is not strongly dependent on the kinetic energy of the explosion for most SNe Ia. Finally, we conﬁrm the correlation of velocity shifts in some nebular lines with the intrinsic B − V color of SNe Ia at maximum light, although several outliers suggest a possible non-monotonic behavior for the largest blueshifts.},

	abstract     = {Traditional cosmological inference using Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) have used stretch- and color-corrected ﬁts of SN Ia light curves and assumed a resulting ﬁducial mean and symmetric intrinsic dispersion for the resulting relative luminosity. As systematics become the main contributors to the error budget, it has become imperative to expand supernova cosmology analyses to include a more general likelihood to model systematics to remove biases with losses in precision. To illustrate an example likelihood analysis, we use a simple model of two populations with a relative luminosity shift, independent intrinsic dispersions, and linear redshift evolution of the relative fraction of each population. Treating observationally viable two-population mock data using a one-population model results in an inferred dark energy equation of state parameter w that is biased by roughly 2 times its statistical error for a sample of N  2500 SNeIa. Modeling the two-population data with a two-population model removes this bias at a cost of an approximately {\textasciitilde}20\% increase in the statistical constraint on w. These signiﬁcant biases can be realized even if the support for two underlying SNeIa populations, in the form of model selection criteria, is inconclusive. With the current observationally estimated difference in the two proposed populations, a sample of N  10,000 SNeIa is necessary to yield conclusive evidence of two populations.},

	abstract     = {The existence of multiple subclasses of type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) has been the subject of great debate in the last decade. One major challenge inevitably met when trying to infer the existence of one or more subclasses is the time consuming, and subjective, process of subclass definition. In this work, we show how machine learning tools facilitate identification of subtypes of SNeIa through the establishment of a hierarchical group structure in the continuous space of spectral diversity formed by these objects. Using Deep Learning, we were capable of performing such identification in a 4 dimensional feature space (+1 for time evolution), while the standard Principal Component Analysis barely achieves similar results using 15 principal components. This is evidence that the progenitor system and the explosion mechanism can be described by a small number of initial physical parameters. As a proof of concept, we show that our results are in close agreement with a previously suggested classification scheme and that our proposed method can grasp the main spectral features behind the definition of such subtypes. This allows the confirmation of the velocity of lines as a first order effect in the determination of SNIa subtypes, followed by 91bg-like events. Given the expected data deluge in the forthcoming years, our proposed approach is essential to allow a quick and statistically coherent identification of SNeIa subtypes (and outliers). All tools used in this work were made publicly available in the Python package Dimensionality Reduction And Clustering for Unsupervised Learning in Astronomy (DRACULA) and can be found within COINtoolbox (https://github.com/COINtoolbox/DRACULA).},

The spectral data were obtained from 1989 to the end of 2008 as part of the Berkeley Supernova Ia Program (BSNIP) and are presented in BSNIP I by Silverman et al., and the photometric data come mainly from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search and are published by Ganeshalingam et al. The spectral measurements are presented and discussed in BSNIP II by Silverman, Kong \& Filippenko, and the light-curve ﬁts and photometric parameters can be found in Ganeshalingam et al. (in preparation). A variety of previously proposed correlations between spectral and photometric parameters are investigated using the large and self-consistent BSNIP data set. We ﬁnd the pseudo-equivalent width (pEW) of the Si II λ4000 line to be a good indicator of light-curve width, and the pEWs of the Mg II and Fe II complexes are relatively good proxies for SN colour. We also employ a combination of light-curve parameters (speciﬁcally the Spectral Adaptive Light-curve Template 2 stretch and colour parameters x1 and c, respectively) and spectral measurements to calculate distance moduli. The residuals from these models are then compared to the standard model which uses only light-curve stretch and colour. Our investigations show that a distance model that uses x1, c and the velocity of the Si II λ6355 feature does not lead to a decrease in the Hubble residuals. We also ﬁnd that distance models with ﬂux ratios alone or in conjunction with light-curve information rarely perform better than the standard (x1, c) model. However, when adopting a distance model which combines the ratio of ﬂuxes near ∼3750 and 4550 Å with both x1 and c, the Hubble residuals are decreased by ∼10 per cent, which is found to be signiﬁcant at about the 2σ level. The weighted root mean square of the residuals using this model is 0.130 ± 0.017 mag (as compared with 0.144 ± 0.019 mag when using the same sample with the standard model). This Hubble diagram ﬁt has one of the smallest scatters ever published and at the highest signiﬁcance ever seen in such a study. Finally, these results are discussed with regard to how they can improve the cosmological accuracy of future, large-scale SN Ia surveys.},

The data were obtained from 1989 to the end of 2008 as part of the Berkeley Supernova Ia Program (BSNIP) and are presented in BSNIP I by Silverman et al. We describe in detail our method of automated, robust spectral feature deﬁnition and measurement which expands upon similar previous studies. Using this procedure, we attempt to measure expansion velocities, pseudo-equivalent widths (pEWs), spectral feature depths and ﬂuxes at the centre and endpoints of each of nine major spectral feature complexes. We investigate how velocity and pEW evolve with time and how they correlate with each other. Various spectral classiﬁcation schemes are employed and quantitative spectral differences among the subclasses are investigated. Several ratios of pEW values are calculated and studied. The so-called Si II ratio, often used as a luminosity indicator, is found to be well correlated with the so-called SiFe ratio and anticorrelated with the analogous ‘SSi ratio’, conﬁrming the results of previous studies. Furthermore, SNe Ia that show strong evidence for interaction with circumstellar material or an aspherical explosion are found to have the largest near-maximum expansion velocities and pEWs, possibly linking extreme values of spectral observables with speciﬁc progenitor or explosion scenarios. We ﬁnd that purely spectroscopic classiﬁcation schemes are useful in identifying the most peculiar SNe Ia. However, in almost all spectral parameters investigated, the full sample of objects spans a nearly continuous range of values. Comparisons to previously published theoretical models of SNe Ia are made and we conclude with a brief discussion of how the measurements performed herein and the possible correlations presented will be important for future SN surveys.},
